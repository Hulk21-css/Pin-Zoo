            <h3>TIGER</h3>
            <p>The tiger is the largest living cat species and one of the most iconic predators in the animal kingdom. Known for its bold orange coat with black stripes, each tiger has a unique stripe pattern—just like human fingerprints. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on large mammals like deer and wild boar.

Tigers are solitary and territorial animals, typically hunting alone and relying on stealth and power to catch their prey. They are excellent swimmers and often cool off in lakes or rivers—unusual behavior among big cats. Tigers mark their territory with scent markings and roars that can be heard up to 3 km (nearly 2 miles) away.

There are several subspecies of tigers, including the Bengal, Siberian, Sumatran, and Malayan tigers, with varying sizes and habitats. Unfortunately, all wild tiger populations are under threat due to habitat loss, poaching, and human conflict. They are listed as Endangered by the IUCN, with fewer than 4,000 left in the wild.

Tigers play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems by controlling prey populations.

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
<p>You will find the tigers at CA03, in the Carnivore Zone, across from the lion enclosure.</p>
