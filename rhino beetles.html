            <h3>RHINO BEETLES</h3>
            <p>Rhinoceros beetles are some of the largest and strongest insects in the world. Named for the prominent horn-like structures on the males' heads—resembling a rhinoceros—they use these horns to battle rivals during mating season. Despite their fierce appearance, they are completely harmless to humans.

These beetles have robust, armored bodies, often dark brown or black, with a glossy sheen. Males are typically much larger than females and can lift objects over 800 times their own body weight. The horns, found only in males, vary in shape and size between species and are used mainly for pushing or flipping opponents.

Rhinoceros beetles are nocturnal and are excellent fliers despite their bulky build. As larvae, they live underground for several years, feeding on decaying plant matter. Adults feed on fruit, nectar, or tree sap and live only a few months.

They are found in tropical and subtropical forests around the world and are admired in many cultures for their strength and unique appearance. Some are even kept as pets.

<p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p>
<p>You will find the rhinoceros beetles at IN04, inside the Invertebrates House, near the butterfly dome.</p>
